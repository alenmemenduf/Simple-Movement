# Simple-Movement
A simple Unity3D scene I made to learn about animation, camera, control, movement and shaders.

## The goal
Everything here is strictly educational. I wanted to learn and practice.

## How I made it
- I took a model of *X bot* and some animations off *Mixamo*. I hooked them up using a blend tree in the animator. 
- I tried using *Cinemachine*, but I couldn't achieve this exact effect I wanted for the camera, so I coded it and used a pivot that I put on the player.

#### Controls are:
| Keys  |Action |
|--------- | ---------|
| Arrows/WASD | Walk |
| Hold Shift | Run | 
| Q | Changing stance |
| Hold right mouse button | Zoom |
| Hover mouse | Aim |
